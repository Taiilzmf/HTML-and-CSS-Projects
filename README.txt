In this course we created a space station. I chose to do a resturant instead. We also created a one page website with html and css which I used to create 
a fan site for Studio Ghibli. We created our own professional portfolio. We also created a full html site which i used to show my hatred
for sloths. We touched on javascript and bootstrap which I liked.
